Help with the flows:

1. Select and customize product
  - Start a new order
  - Select original
  - Select sugar milk glaze
  - Select a batch of 3
  - Proceed to checkout
2. Walk through checkout and recieve confirmation
    - Fill out details
    - Fill out address
    - Fill out payment
    - Review information submitted
    - Place order
    - Recieve confirmation




Extra work done:

- I wanted to make everything as interactive as possible
  - Normal, hover, active, and past states for:
      - links
      - buttons
      - product cards (just hover)
      - internal navigation buttons (no hover states, just clickable)
      - form elements
          - input (including focus)
          - selection (including focus)
- I added multiple pages to the order and checkout flow
    - I wanted to stay true to the nature of my prototype and take the user on an actual walkthrough of the project
    - To clarify, there are no extra flows for customizing a product
